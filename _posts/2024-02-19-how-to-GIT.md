# Getting Started with Git: A Beginner's Guide

If you're new to the world of software development, you've likely heard about Git. Git is a powerful version control system that helps developers manage their code efficiently. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of Git and how to get started with it.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase over time. It helps teams collaborate on projects, maintain a history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.

## How to Install Git

Before you can start using Git, you'll need to install it on your computer. Here's how to do it:

1. **Windows**: Download the installer from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Mac**: Git comes pre-installed on macOS. You can check if Git is installed by opening the Terminal and running the command `git --version`. If Git is not installed, you can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `brew install git`.

3. **Linux**: You can install Git using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install git`.

## Basic Git Commands

Once Git is installed, you can start using it to manage your code. Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clones an existing Git repository to your local machine.
- `git add <file>`: Adds changes in the working directory to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "commit message"`: Records changes staged in the index to the repository.
- `git push`: Sends committed changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
