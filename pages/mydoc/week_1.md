## Data Types and Variables

In C programming, understanding data types and variables is crucial for effective coding. Unlike modern languages where data types are often inferred, C requires explicit declaration. Data types play a crucial role in shaping how data is stored, manipulated, and utilized in a program. Let's explore the built-in data types in C and how to work with variables.

### 1. Integer ('int') Data Type

The `int` data type is used for variables storing integer values. 
In C, integers occupy 4 bytes of memory (32 bits). The range of values for integers is from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1, accommodating both positive and negative values.
This range is split into negative and positive integers, with zero included. Approximately, this covers values from negative 2 billion to positive 2 billion.

<pre>
<code>
    int number;         // Declaration
    number = 17;        // Assignment
    int anotherNumber = 42;  // Declaration and Initialization
</code>
</pre>

### 2. Unsigned Integer ('unsigned int')
The `unsigned int` data type is a modification of `int` that exclusively represents non-negative values. Unlike the regular int, the unsigned int excludes negative values, effectively doubling the positive range to 0 to 2^32 - 1.

When you use an unsigned int, you are declaring a variable that can only hold non-negative integers. This allows for a positive range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1), as there are no negative values included.

<pre>
<code>
    unsigned int positiveNumber = 100;  // Declaration and Initialization
</code>
</pre>

### 3. Character ('char') Data Type
The `char` data type is used for variables storing single characters. Characters occupy 1 byte of memory (8 bits), and their values are defined by the ASCII standard.

<pre>
<code>
    char letter;           // Declaration
    letter = 'A';          // Assignment
    char symbol = '$';     // Declaration and Initialization
</code>
</pre>

### 4. Floating Point (float and double) Data Types
Floating-point numbers are used to represent real numbers that have a decimal point. In C, there are two primary floating-point data types: `float` and `double`.

- **`float`:** This data type occupies 4 bytes of memory, providing a balance between precision and storage.

    <pre>
    <code>
        float pi = 3.14;       // Declaration and Initialization
    </code>
    </pre>

- **`double`:** The double data type, also known as double precision, uses 8 bytes of memory, offering increased precision compared to `float`. 

    <pre>
    <code>
        double precisePi = 3.141592653589793;  // Declaration and Initialization
    </code>
    </pre>

### 5. 'Void' Type
The `void` in C is used to indicate that a function doesn't return any value. While void itself isn't a data type for variables, it serves as a return type for functions.

<pre>
<code>
    int main(void) {
        // Code for the main function
        return 0;  // Indicating successful program execution to the operating system
    }
</code>
</pre>
or 

<pre>
<code>
    int main() {
        // Code for the main function
        return 0;  // Indicating successful program execution to the operating system
    }
</code>
</pre>

In both cases, the void inside the parentheses indicates that main takes no parameters. It's a common practice to use void in this context to explicitly state that main does not expect any 'command-line arguments'. While the int in int main is a historical convention, the void indicates the absence of parameters in the 'function' signature.

These examples showcase the use of void in the main function, emphasizing that int main(void) is a conventional declaration, and void signifies that there are no parameters.

In succeeding weeks, you'll encounter the `void` type in functions. Consider a function printMessage that prints a greeting message. Since this function doesn't return any value, it has a return type of void.

<pre>
<code>
    void printMessage() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
    }
</code>
</pre>


### CS50 Library Data Types

CS50 provides additional data types through its library, including `bool` and `string`.

### 1. Bool ('bool') Data Type
The `bool` data type is used for variables storing Boolean values (true or false). Booleans are fundamental in programming logic, enabling the representation of conditions and decision-making in code.

```vbnet
    #include <cs50.h>
    bool isTrue = true;    // Declaration and Initialization
```
### 2. String ('string') Data Type
The `string` data type is used for variables storing sequences of characters, representing words or text. Strings are crucial for handling textual information in programs.

```vbnet
    #include <cs50.h>
    string greeting = "Hello";  // Declaration and Initialization
```

## CS50 Library and other Libraries

A **library in C** is a collection of pre-compiled routines, functions, and data types that can be reused in different programs. These libraries simplify programming by providing ready-made solutions for common tasks. Libraries typically contain functions and data types that extend the capabilities of the base programming language.

In C, the `#include` directive is used to include libraries in your program. When you include a library, you gain access to the functions and data types it provides, allowing you to use them in your code.

### CS50 Library

The CS50 library is a specific library provided by the CS50 course. It extends the capabilities of C by introducing additional data types, such as bool and string, and providing functions that simplify certain tasks. To use the CS50 library in your program, you include the following line at the beginning:

```vbnet
    #include <cs50.h>
```
This line tells the compiler to include the CS50 library, making its features available for use in your code. For more information on the CS50 library, you can visit [CS50 Library Documentation](https://manual.cs50.io/){:target="_blank"}.

### Various Libraries

As you continue your programming journey, you'll encounter various other libraries. These could be standard libraries that come with the programming language (like `<stdio.h>` in C) or third-party libraries that provide specialized functionalities.

Additionally, you'll have opportunities to create your own libraries. Creating a library involves grouping related functions and data types into a separate file that can be reused across different programs. This modular approach to programming enhances code organization and reusability.

## Declaration and Initialization

**Declaration** and **Initialization** are two distinct concepts related to the creation and use of variables.

### Declaration
Declaration is the process of announcing the existence and characteristics of a variable to the compiler. When you declare a variable, you are essentially telling the compiler what type of data the variable will store, and you're providing a name for that variable.

In C, a variable declaration typically includes two main parts: the data type and the variable name.

```vbnet
    int number;  // Declaration of an integer variable named 'number'
```
In this example, int is the data type, and number is the variable name. This line informs the compiler that a variable named number of type int (integer) will be used in the program.

### Initialization
Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of declaration or later in the program. When you initialize a variable, you provide it with an initial value.

```vbnet
    int anotherNumber = 42;  // Declaration and Initialization of an integer variable
```
In this example, the variable anotherNumber is not only declared but also initialized with the value 42 at the same time. Initialization is optional, and you can declare a variable first and assign a value to it later in your program.

```vbnet
    int yetAnotherNumber;  // Declaration
    yetAnotherNumber = 99;  // Initialization (at a later point)
```
Here, the variable yetAnotherNumber is declared first and initialized with the value 99 later in the program.

## Operators
**Operators** in C are used to perform various operations on operands, which can be variables, constants, or expressions. These operations range from basic arithmetic calculations to logical comparisons.

### Assignment Operator (=)

The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable in C.

```vbnet
    int x = 10; // Declare an integer variable x and assign the value 10 to it
```

{% include note.html content="Equality (==) vs. Assignment (=): Be cautious about using the correct operator. == is used for comparison, while = is used for assignment."
%}

### Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)

Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations on numeric values.

```vbnet
    int x = y + 1;  // Addition
    x = x * 5;      // Multiplication
    int m = 13 % 4; // Modulus (gives the remainder of division)
```

### Shorthand Assignment Operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

Shorthand assignment operators combine an arithmetic operation with assignment in a more concise form.

```vbnet
    x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5
```
{% include note.html content="Shorthand Assignment Operators: They provide a concise way to update variable values and can make your code more readable." %}


### Increment and Decrement Operators (++ and --)

Increment (++) adds 1 to a variable, and decrement (--) subtracts 1 from a variable.

```vbnet
    x++; // Equivalent to x = x + 1
```

### Modulus Operator (%)

The modulus operator (%) calculates the remainder when dividing two numbers.

```vbnet
    int m = 13 % 4; // m will be 1 (remainder of 13 divided by 4)
```

### Boolean Expressions and Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)

Boolean expressions evaluate to true or false. Logical operators perform operations on Boolean values.

```vbnet
    int x = 10, y = 5;
    if (x > y && y != 0) {
        // Code to execute if both conditions are true
    }

    if (x < y || y == 0) {
        // Code to execute if at least one condition is true
    }

    if (!(x == y)) {
        // Code to execute if the condition is false
    }
```

{% include note.html content="Logical Operators (&&, ||, !): These are commonly used in conditional statements and loops to control program flow based on conditions."
%}

### Relational Operators (<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=)

Relational operators compare values and return true or false based on the comparison.

```vbnet
    if (x < y) {
    // Code to execute if x is less than y
    }

    if (x >= y) {
        // Code to execute if x is greater than or equal to y
    }

    if (x == y) {
        // Code to execute if x is equal to y
    }

    if (x != y) {
        // Code to execute if x is not equal to y
    }
```
