# CS50 Week 0: Let's Start from Scratch!

## Share the Excitement üåü

If you found Professor David J. Malan's Week 0 lecture amazing, share the love! Please consider spreading the word about our CS50 Community Notes website.

He must have explained Computer Science thoroughly, and here's a quick rundown:

## Computer Science Fundamentals

**Computer Science** provides a solid foundation for understanding how computers work and tackling problems with computational methods.

Now, if that sounds a bit nerdy, trust me, that's the beauty of it! This course doesn't just teach us the basics of programming; it transforms the way we think, making us process information like a computer. It starts with updating our brains regularly with more Computer Science knowledge, guiding us in creating schedules for weekly lectures, helping allocate time and energy to learn CS50. And guess what? These habits stick even after the course ends!

### Computational Thinking

Computational Thinking involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, and solving them step by step.

It is more than just a concept, but like the secret code to problem solving.  As you progress through this course and embark on a potential career in Computer Science or navigate life in general, you'll realize that what once seemed like a tangled web of complications becomes surprisingly simple.

In CS50, there's no such thing as a difficult problem, only solutions that might look a bit complicated at first. It's the magic of thinking like a computer scientist‚Äîseeing challenges not as insurmountable obstacles, but as puzzles waiting to be solved.

{% include note.html content="üí°Remember this golden rule: Think simply, and you'll find yourself effortlessly conquering the seemingly impossible. So, embrace the power of Computational Thinking, and watch those complex problems unravel into beautifully solvable pieces! 
" %}

### Problem Solving: Inputs, Outputs

At the heart of every computational challenge is a system, a digital ecosystem where information flows in and out. The system takes inputs, processes them through various operations, and produces outputs. These inputs and outputs are the lifeblood of problem-solving in computer science.

**Real World Analogy:**
Think of it like being in a kitchen. You start with ingredients **(input)**, follow a recipe **(code)**, and end up with a delicious dish **(output)**. The cooking process, or what happens in between, is what we're diving into in CS50.

## Representation: Unary, Binary, Decimal, ASCII, Unicode, RGB

Data representation is the cornerstone of encoding information in a format that machines can understand. It's like speaking different languages to convey the same message, where each language has its own set of rules.

### Unary System

Unary is the simplest numeral system. It represents numbers using only one symbol, typically '1'. While not commonly used in computing due to its inefficiency for larger numbers, unary serves as a fundamental concept to understand numeral systems.

### Binary System

Binary, the language of computers, employs a base-2 numeral system using only '0' and '1'. Every piece of data in a computer is fundamentally stored and processed in binary. It's the backbone of machine language and digital communication.
   
### Decimal System

Decimal is our everyday base-10 numeral system, using digits 0-9. Decimal is familiar to us humans and is often used for human-readable representations of numbers in various contexts.

### ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

## Abstraction, Algorithms

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential details. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve specific problems.

## Running Times, Pseudocode

Efficiency in algorithms is crucial. Running times and pseudocode help analyze and design efficient algorithms.


```
1. Start a New Project:
   a. Open Scratch and click on "Create."
   b. Choose a backdrop and sprite to begin.

---

2. Code Your Sprite:
   a. Drag and drop code blocks to control your sprite's behavior.
   b. Use motion blocks for movement and looks blocks for appearance.

---

3. Add Interactivity:
   a. Use sensing blocks to respond to user inputs or events.
   b. Create loops and conditionals for dynamic behavior.

---

4. Incorporate Sound and Effects:
   a. Add sound blocks to enhance the project with audio.
   b. Experiment with visual effects for a polished look.

---

5. Test and Share:
   a. Click the green flag to test your project.
   b. Share your creation with others on the Scratch platform.

```

## Scratch: Functions, Variables, Boolean Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Events, Threads

Scratch introduces fundamental programming concepts:
- **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code.
- **Variables:** Containers for storing data.
- **Boolean Expressions:** Conditions that evaluate to true or false.
- **Conditionals:** Control flow based on conditions.
- **Loops:** Repeat blocks of code.
- **Events:** Triggers based on user actions.
- **Threads:** Independent sequences of instructions.

## An Interesting Story

In 2003, the MIT Media Lab developed Scratch to make programming accessible to everyone, particularly young learners. Since then, it has grown into a global community of creators, fostering creativity and coding skills in a playful environment.

## Basic Projects in Scratch

1. **Create Your Sprite:** Start by designing your own character to represent you in the Scratch world.
2. **Animate a Sprite:** Use motion and looks blocks to make your sprite move and change appearance.
3. **Interactive Story:** Build a simple story where users can make decisions that affect the outcome.
