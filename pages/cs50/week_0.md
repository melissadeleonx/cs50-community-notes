# CS50 Week 0: Let's Start from Scratch!

## Share the Excitement üåü

If you found Professor David J. Malan's Week 0 lecture amazing, share the love! Please consider spreading the word about our CS50 Community Notes website.

He must have explained Computer Science thoroughly, and here's a quick rundown:

## Computer Science Fundamentals

**Computer Science** provides a solid foundation for understanding how computers work and tackling problems with computational methods.

Now, if that sounds a bit nerdy, trust me, that's the beauty of it! This course doesn't just teach us the basics of programming; it transforms the way we think, making us process information like a computer. It starts with updating our brains regularly with more Computer Science knowledge, guiding us in creating schedules for weekly lectures, helping allocate time and energy to learn CS50. And guess what? These habits stick even after the course ends!

### Sample CS50 Schedule

Here's a simple table to help you plan your CS50 learning journey:

| Day         | Activity                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Monday      | Watch CS50 Lecture                        |
| Tuesday     | Do not skip Shorts and Sections           |
| Wednesday   | Review Lecture Notes and Concepts         |
| Thursday    | Join CS50 Discussion Section              |
| Friday      | Complete Problem Set                      |
| Saturday    | Explore Advanced Topics                   |
| Sunday      | Reflect, Plan, and Prepare for Next Week  |

### Computational Thinking

Computational Thinking involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, and solving them step by step.

It is more than just a concept, but like the secret code to problem solving.  As you progress through this course and embark on a potential career in Computer Science or navigate life in general, you'll realize that what once seemed like a tangled web of complications becomes surprisingly simple.

In CS50, there's no such thing as a difficult problem, only solutions that might look a bit complicated at first. It's the magic of thinking like a computer scientist‚Äîseeing challenges not as insurmountable obstacles, but as puzzles waiting to be solved.

{% include note.html content="üí°Remember this golden rule: Think simply, and you'll find yourself effortlessly conquering the seemingly impossible. So, embrace the power of Computational Thinking, and watch those complex problems unravel into beautifully solvable pieces! 
" %}

### Problem Solving: Inputs, Outputs

Understanding the input and output of a system is crucial for problem-solving in computer science.

## Representation: Unary, Binary, Decimal, ASCII, Unicode, RGB

Data representation is the way information is stored and encoded. This includes unary, binary, decimal numeral systems, as well as character encoding systems like ASCII and Unicode, and color representation like RGB.

## Abstraction, Algorithms

Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential details. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions to solve specific problems.

## Running Times, Pseudocode

Efficiency in algorithms is crucial. Running times and pseudocode help analyze and design efficient algorithms.

## Scratch: Functions, Variables, Boolean Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Events, Threads

Scratch introduces fundamental programming concepts:
- **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code.
- **Variables:** Containers for storing data.
- **Boolean Expressions:** Conditions that evaluate to true or false.
- **Conditionals:** Control flow based on conditions.
- **Loops:** Repeat blocks of code.
- **Events:** Triggers based on user actions.
- **Threads:** Independent sequences of instructions.

## An Interesting Story

In 2003, the MIT Media Lab developed Scratch to make programming accessible to everyone, particularly young learners. Since then, it has grown into a global community of creators, fostering creativity and coding skills in a playful environment.

## Basic Projects in Scratch

1. **Create Your Sprite:** Start by designing your own character to represent you in the Scratch world.
2. **Animate a Sprite:** Use motion and looks blocks to make your sprite move and change appearance.
3. **Interactive Story:** Build a simple story where users can make decisions that affect the outcome.
