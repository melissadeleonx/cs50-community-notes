## Learning Platforms Offering CS50

CS50, Harvard University's introductory computer science course, is acclaimed for its thorough instruction in fundamental Computer Science and Programming concepts. The course focuses on cultivating computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, and data structures, equipping students with robust problem-solving skills. Explore the following platforms to access CS50 lectures or enroll in the course:

### 1. Harvard Extension School

Many Harvard Extension courses like **CS50 (aka CSCI E-50)** are open enrollment, but students must fulfill certain requirements, such as placement tests, in order to register. For those seeking credit-bearing options and a more formalized learning experience, explore **[Harvard Extension School](https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/2024/spring/syllabus/){:target="_blank"}**. Visit their official website to find detailed information on enrollment procedures, tuition fees, and potential academic credits associated with CS50.

### 2. CS50x on edX

**[edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science){:target="_blank"}** stands out as a leading online learning platform, co-founded by Harvard University and MIT. This platform collaborates with institutions worldwide to provide a diverse array of courses, including the renowned CS50, Harvard University's introductory computer science course.

CS50 is readily accessible on edX for free, allowing learners to audit the course. This grants access to lectures, problem sets, and other materials without any financial commitment.

For those seeking formal recognition, enrolling in CS50 for a verified certificate is an option, albeit with associated fees. This certificate serves as a valuable credential, attesting to the learner's completion and proficiency in the course.

{% include note.html content="edX demonstrates a commitment to accessibility by offering up to a 90% discount on verified certificates for learners facing financial constraints. Financial assistance is available in most courses that provide verified certificates." %}

### 3. CS50 OpenCourseWare

**[CS50 OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/){:target="_blank"}** can be freely accessed without formal registration through edX. However, for a more enriched experience, including progress tracking and official course participation, free registration on edX is recommended. Here's how to make the most of your CS50 OpenCourseWare experience:

1. Access Without Registration: Explore CS50 OpenCourseWare directly for free, allowing you to peruse course materials and delve into the content without the need for formal registration.

2. Enhanced Experience with edX: To officially join the course, monitor your progress, and participate in the CS50 community, register for free on edX. This step ensures a comprehensive learning experience with additional features.

3. Connect to GitHub: For an optimized coding experience, connect your CS50x account to GitHub. This connection facilitates activities in the Codespace, where coding assignments are executed seamlessly.

4. Visit Your CS50x Account: Once registered on edX, visit your personalized CS50x account at **[cs50.me/cs50x](cs50.me/cs50x){:target="_blank"}** to access resources, submit assignments, and monitor your progress throughout the course.

{% include note.html content="Free and verified certificates offered are not accredited academic offerings from Harvard or its affiliates. These certificates are intended for self-educational and vocational purposes." %}

### 4. Youtube and FreeCodeCamp

CS50's **[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380F_inVRXMIHCqLaNUd7bN4){:target="_blank"}** offers a wealth of resources, there are a variety of content such as lectures, shorts, and sections. This platform provides the flexibility to learn at your own pace, allowing you to engage with the material on a familiar video-sharing platform. CS50's YouTube presence extends the reach of the course to a broader audience, making learning accessible to those who prefer the visual and dynamic nature of video content.

Additionally, FreeCodeCamp hosts a **[26-hour video of the CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfaMVlDaQ24){:target="_blank"}** , providing an alternative avenue for in-depth learning. This extensive video resource on FreeCodeCamp offers a comprehensive experience, allowing learners to immerse themselves in the course content over an extended period.

### 5. Who can take this course?

**ANYONE. ANYWHERE.** CS50 courses are free for all. But please note that it is well-suited for learners aged 12 and above. Younger learners may require assistance from a parent, and local laws may impact their access to certain services associated with the course.
